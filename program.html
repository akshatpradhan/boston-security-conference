              Josh More has worked as a security consultant, developer and system
              administrator. This has given him the experience to know when and why
              security projects often fail, and how to maximize success. Josh holds
              multiple security and technical certifications and has served in a
              leadership position on several security-focused groups. Josh believes
              that security works best from a holistic approach, and works all
              angles: risk assessments, posture analysis, incident response, malware
              analysis, infrastructure defense, system forensics, employee training
              and business strategy.

              employing more "active" defenses along with developing intelligence
              about threat actors has started. We will discuss developing a defense

              how to analyze and extract data from attacks against your environment,

              We cannot “firewall” or “patch” our way to secure
              websites. In the past, security professionals thought
              firewalls, Secure Sockets Layer (SSL), patching, and
              privacy policies were enough. Today, however, these
              methods are outdated and ineffective, as attacks on
              prominent, well-protected websites are occurring every
              day. Organizations around the world rely on highly
              accurate, scalable and continuous Web security services
              to maintain the safety of their websites in today’s
              hostile online environment. This talk will discuss the
              10 most important security-centric computer programming
              techniques necessary to build low-risk web-based
              applications. Real-world tradeoffs will be discussed in
              detail for each "control" and "control category"

              6. How we learned security from Steve

            <p>Security is not always hard, but it is not natural to how
            we normally do things. In our family’s search for a better
            way, we came across a man named Steve. Our first
            impressions of Steve were not of a security guru, but as
            we came to know him we found he “got” security better than
            most people. Steve dug deep and was able to build a sound
            security program from the ground up by cobbling up the
            resources he needed and crafting them into all the tools
            required. The lessons Steve passed on to us have been some
            of the most valuable in our quest for being more
            secure. In this talk we will share our journey with Steve
            and the things we learned along the way. From perimeter
            security to protecting the crown jewels, from physical
            security to online privacy, taking minimal resources and
            growing them into a vast storehouse, and beyond to lessons
            of life’s basic logic. By sharing Steve’s lessons of how
            to be secure maybe we can win this game and make
            ourselves, our families, and our organizations more
            secure.</p>

            of the family are three sons and a daughter. All four kids
            have taken to technology and wage psychological warfare on
            their parents, but the three sons have decided to team up
            with dad and share some important lessons families need in
            being secure. Ghostnomadjr is a 6th grader and second
            degree black belt in Tae Kwon Do along with being a

              In this talk, a bridge is built between the contemporary
              understanding of highly technical Social Engineering and the long
              standing art of the swindle and confidence game. There is particular
              emphasis put on the specialized argot of the turn of the century
              American confidence man as documented by David W. Maurer. The overall
              objective of the brief is to show that the world of Internet based
              Social Engineering can and should be described, categorized, and
              understood trough existing taxonomies of classical grift techniques
              and language.

              With the surge of mobile devices accessing not only external web
              applications, but also internal company systems, organizations are
              increasingly worried about the potential risk for data breach and data
              loss that exists. While many packaged solutions have been developed to
              combat the risks, organizations face budget constraints and a lack of
              experienced staff to implement these solutions. Companies are
              increasingly turning to application security assessments of mobile
              solutions to reduce their exposure to these risks. This talk
              will introduce the viewer to the concept of a mobile application
              security assessment, how it differs from traditional web or network
              assessments and dive into the tools and techniques auditors use when
              searching for security issues on mobile devices.

              The US Department of Transportation is considering
              mandating a system for inclusion in all light vehicles
              that would allow them to broadcast their position and
              velocity on a more-or-less continuous basis. The system
              is claimed to have the capability to prevent up to 80%
              of all unimpaired collisions. We discuss the security
              needs, the constraints due to cost and other issues, and
              the efforts that are being made to ensure that the
              system will not compromise end-user privacy.

              “Am I compromised now?” At Mandiant, we are often tasked
              with helping our clients answer that question. To do
              this effectively, we have to be able to find “unknown
              evil” across enterprises consisting of tens of thousands
              of systems. One method we use is called stacking. To do
              this, we collect information about hosts in the target
              environment (installed services, running processes,
              directory listings, etc.) and “stack” this data to
              identify anomalies and find traces of previously unknown
              attacker activity. In this talk, we will walk you
              through how we do this, using real world examples where
              we identified attacker activity that evaded standard
              detection mechanisms implemented by our clients.
