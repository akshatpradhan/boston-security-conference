              Manufacturing, this talk illustrates a smarter
              way to strategize security. Learn how to think differently and

              employing more "active" defenses along with developing intelligence
              about threat actors has started. We will discuss developing a defense

              how to analyze and extract data from attacks against your environment,

              We cannot “firewall” or “patch” our way to secure
              websites. In the past, security professionals thought
              firewalls, Secure Sockets Layer (SSL), patching, and
              privacy policies were enough. Today, however, these
              methods are outdated and ineffective, as attacks on
              prominent, well-protected websites are occurring every
              day. Organizations around the world rely on highly
              accurate, scalable and continuous Web security services
              to maintain the safety of their websites in today’s
              hostile online environment. This talk will discuss the
              10 most important security-centric computer programming
              techniques necessary to build low-risk web-based
              applications. Real-world tradeoffs will be discussed in

              “Am I compromised now?” At Mandiant, we are often tasked
              with helping our clients answer that question. To do
              this effectively, we have to be able to find “unknown
              evil” across enterprises consisting of tens of thousands
              of systems. One method we use is called stacking. To do
              this, we collect information about hosts in the target
              environment (installed services, running processes,
              directory listings, etc.) and “stack” this data to
              identify anomalies and find traces of previously unknown
              attacker activity. In this talk, we will walk you
              through how we do this, using real world examples where
              we identified attacker activity that evaded standard
              detection mechanisms implemented by our clients.

              understood trough existing taxonomies of classical grift techniques
              and language.

              7. Introduction to mobile application security assessments
              <hr />

              With the surge of mobile devices accessing not only external web
              applications, but also internal company systems, organizations are
              increasingly worried about the potential risk for data breach and data
              loss that exists. While many packaged solutions have been developed to
              combat the risks, organizations face budget constraints and a lack of
              experienced staff to implement these solutions. Companies are
              increasingly turning to application security assessments of mobile
              solutions to reduce their exposure to these risks. This talk
              will introduce the viewer to the concept of a mobile application
              security assessment, how it differs from traditional web or network
              assessments and dive into the tools and techniques auditors use when
              searching for security issues on mobile devices.

              The US Department of Transportation is considering
              mandating a system for inclusion in all light vehicles
              that would allow them to broadcast their position and
              velocity on a more-or-less continuous basis. The system
              is claimed to have the capability to prevent up to 80%
              of all unimpaired collisions. We discuss the security
              needs, the constraints due to cost and other issues, and
              the efforts that are being made to ensure that the
              system will not compromise end-user privacy.
